                    "description": "This loop is actually several trails which all connect to each other and form the loop. Start out riding up Keystone Gulch. You will climb gradually on this fairly well maintained dirt road for about 4.5 miles. Just after the road veers left, after the third chairlift, look for a road taking off to the right near a large maintenance building. There is a sign here but the day I rode this it was wrapped in plastic and leaning against a tree. At about 5 miles and crossing two ski runs, take the road to the right. Look for a round sign with a blue arrow. There are also bright red signs with bicycle symbol on them marking the trail. Many of these signs however are in disrepair so don't rely on them, but if you do see one you will know you are on the right trail. At this point the trail goes down through a meadow and accross a very small stream. After you cross the stream begin the climb up the westridge to the Colorado Trail. After about three miles the trail intersects the Colorado Trail. At this point you should see the markers (a triangle symbol) identifying the Colorado Trail. Take the sharp right here. Meander across the westridge for a few miles and stay left at the next fork (appx. 8 mi.) If you go right here you will go back down to Keystone gulch. From here the Colorado Trail begins it's long and fast descent toward Breckenridge. After a couple miles descending, the Colorado Trail will make a VERY sharp turn to the left and Red's trail will be the straight option. I believe there is a post at this intersection. Go straight onto Red's Trail and follow the narrow singletrack along a steep hillside and eventually back into the forest. After a few more miles this trail will terminate with a choice of dirt road to the left or more singletrack to the right. Take the single track to the right which is Keystone Ranch Trail. Follow this trail for a few miles. The golf course will be on your left. Cross a few roads and this trail will turn into the Aqueduct trail. Follow the aquaduct trail around the mountain and back to Keystone gulch. Once you come out on the road turn left back to your car.",

The first will be at the intersection of Western Blvd, the second will be at Centennial Campus, the third will be at Gorman Street, and the last light just blinks. After you pass the blinking lights it is less than a half mile to the lake, where the road will continue to cross the lake. You can park before you cross the bridge, and take the asphalt path around the lake. You will come to a bridge, that crosses a spillway. Cross the bridge and the trail starts immediatly to your right. If you are coming from I-40, get off at Gorman Street and head towards NC State. When you get to the light you will be at the intersection of Gorman and Avent Ferry; turn left. Use the rest of the directions from above. If you want to ride the other side of the lake, you can cross the bridge on the road, and there is a turnoff on the right side of the road, the trail starts here.",

                    "description": "This is another trail that rides around the perimeter of a lake. This trail is only about roots, roots, and more roots. This trail can be rough on you back, wrists, etc. This trail, which is mostly singletrack, is a good trail to beat up yourself on. I first hated this trail but have come to like it seeing as how I am in such close proximity to it. Give it a try, you may be suprised. The other side of the trail across the bridge is now open again, and is is in better shape than the rootier (is that a word?!?) trail. This side of the lake, is not as rooty. Elevation change includes short uphills and descents.. Length is 1-2 miles.. This trail is not that tough, if you avoid the roots by riding the side of the trail. There are a few log crossings for the brave of heart (wait till you see them) and a few that I can cross (in other words, up to one foot-don't laugh). There is already erosion so its good not to ride this trail in the rain.  Kent has marked off a new trail at Lake Johnson. You can get there by staying on the paved path starting at the hilly side of the lake. Follow the paved path through the two large hills and start looking to the right as the paved path meets up with the loop on the left. There is an existing trail on the right that leads to Lake Dam Rd. Follow the trail approximately 1/4 mile and start looking for the bright pink markers on your left. The trail winds through a wooded meadow and ends up on a gravel road. Follow the gravel road to the right and it will take you to Lake Dam Rd. Go left on Lake Dam to the entrance of the park. A trail will soon be marked to get from the gravel road to the main part of Lake Johnson so you wont have to go back out to Lake Dam Rd. The new trail is fun and will eventually provide Lake Johnson with a full Loop ride instead of an out and back route. ",

Turn left and keep going until you see the sign for the Visitor Center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Nasr City/Heliopolis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head west on the ring road and take the Carrefour exit.

There is a rather long and steep climb on the road leading to the ring road from Nasr City. The distance between Nasr City (starting at Abbas El Akkad St., for example) and the Wadi entrance is about 21km. Be prepared for a 45-55 km &quot;endurance&quot; ride if you plan to go by bike from and to Nasr City/Heliopolis.

Omega loop is similar terrain with a couple of sections that can be fast if you want them to be. Fun trails if you live in the area. You will get a work out. Plenty of rock gardens to keep you on your toes.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Description from fredgames:&lt;/b&gt;<br />Brier Creek consists of two stacked loops with a connector in between. The first loop is called Waterfall and second Omega. There is also a new, beautiful connector trail that goes off Omega. It has great lake views as well as rock outcroppings and a waterfall. At the end of the connector trail you cross two pontoons to get on the Pointe Loop. This is still under construction but should be done by Fall 2014. There is also a downhill flow trail in the works. This is a great trail system, a diamond in the rough that is roughly 10 miles from the Big Hollow Trail system at Mammoth Cave.",

Mile Creek Trail itself is a great 14-mile out-and-back jaunt.  At first, it gradually rolls up at the base of the mountains; when in the trees, it gets a bit steeper until you hit the switchbacks, of which there are many; however, the pitch isn't too steep.  There are some loose, large rocks here and there, but they are easy to avoid.  You climb to about 10,000 ft. when you get to the turnaround point.  Of course, the trail continues down the other side, if you want to explore.  Do further research of the area.  Be careful of bears.  Hikers and bikers are cautioned to not hike/ride alone, but if you are careful, carry bear spray, you should be okay.  I saw one, small black bear, but there are grizzlies.  I heard a local story that a biker was attacked by a grizzly years ago.  Just use caution and enjoy the incredible scenery.",

The views are stupendous on a good day.  On a bad day you don't want to be there! The best way up is perhaps via Mapp Track and Cob Cottage Track. I went straight up the Mount Vernon track but it's too steep to ride for some of the way.  Another way up is from the top of the mountain bike park on the Taylor View Track.  But all the trails are two way four wheel drive farm tracks so you can take your pick!",

Many visitors enjoy the picnic area, playground, volleyball court or use the park's large open areas for ball games, throwing Frisbees, and also for events. There is a canoe/kayak launch available, a nature trail and a boardwalk that overlooks the river. In the summer the gazebo at the end of the boardwalk is a fine place to watch sturgeon jumping. Manatees are often seen in the springs during the winter months and occasionally in the summer. White-tailed deer, gray squirrels, red-shouldered hawks, pileated woodpeckers, and barred owls are some of the other animals seen in the park. Reserve a canoe or kayak by calling Suwannee Guides and Outfitters at (352) 542-8331. If you bring a pet please remember they must be on a hand held leash no longer than six feet. For the safety of our non-pet owning guests, there are restricted areas (the main picnic and swimming areas). Please observe signs and restrict pets to more remote sections of the park.

As of 2012 it seems they've done some trail work and smoothed out several sections that where once much harder.  There are several fallen trees you'll have to work around, some have been turned into fun little log piles to ride over.  The ride is mostly through dense forrest perfect for hot summer days.

Today, Arcadia Campground is the first campground visitors encounter on their way up Mount Graham by way of the Swift Trail (AZ 366), which was built by those Depression-era workers. Arcadia Campground is shaded by stands of tall ponderosa pine interspersed with Gambel oaks and Arizona walnuts. Such a diverse habitat makes this an excellent area for bird watching. The Arcadia Trail starts here and leads up the mountain to Shannon Campground. A one mile spur off this trail leads to the top of Heliograph Peak.",
